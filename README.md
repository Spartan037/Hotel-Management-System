<h2>Hotel Management System</h2>
<br>The project hotel management system is a web-based application that allows the hotel
manager to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage
various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very flexible and convenient. The
hotel manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit and manage the
entire activities manually on paper. This application gives him/her the power and
flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online system. Hotel management
project provides room reservation, staff management and other necessary hotel
management features. The system allows the manager to see available rooms in the
system. Customers can view and ask for room reservation online. Admin has the power
of either approving or disapproving the customer's booking request. Other hotel services
can also be viewed by the customers and can book them too. The system is hence useful
for both customers and managers to portably manage the hotel activities.
